Sharing experiences, failures, and discoveries on a way to build a foundation in life, and go forward (So many times I've been at square one). 

Here is what is nice to address at a certain age (that's still a work in progress): 
At 25+ years old: individuation - interdependence instead of codependence, financial independence whenever possible. 

At 30+ years old: Faith becomes important. To find your tribe, perhaps a spiritual community. 

I believe in God. Jesus is a true hero. I am also curious about Religious society of Friends, and practice some Buddha's teachings.
