What's if pride gets in your way? Perceive this superiority or inferiority complex? 

Reddit [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ohkojc/how_do_you_personally_deal_with_pride_and_a/)

"""Practice loving kindness and patience. Do good works for others. Do not argue back when accused wrongly. Do not defend yourself when ridiculed. Bow to statues of Buddhas, bow to monks, bow to people and consider everyone your teacher. For every disparaging thought of others, make yourself think something respectable about them.

Pride and superiority comes from embittered insecurity. They are two sides of the same coin. You may not be able to identify that insecurity yet because your practice seems weak. Your virtue is lacking and thus your meditation is faltering."""

another post on pride: 
"""
My advice to you is to begin by examining pride/vanity. What it is, how it manifests, etc. Secondary to this: cultivate humility. Humility is the antidote to pride. This will take time because humility isn't a static quality, it's a behavior, it's a choice. So this is about developing the habit of choosing humility.

Humility doesn't mean becoming a doormat, mind you. There's quite a bit of strength in it.
"""

"""other bit of advice is to take stock of your life and see if there is anything that is triggering for you that causes you to behave in toxic ways. If there are then you should avoid them. Think of how alcoholics don't really hang out in bars; we should avoid the things that have a propensity to set us to unskillful behaviors.

"""

"""
It may be worth remembering Emptiness is one of the pillars of liberation.

It may well be true that you have acted in a selfish, ungrateful, and unskillful way. But that doesn't mean YOU are those things. Assigning all of those negative things as a core identity of YOU will only further your frustration, because you are buying into the narrative that's fundamentally what you are.
