Search for Spiritual home. 

I've searched for feedback, compassionate human interaction there. Someone capable and more importantly willing to listen, understand. To bridge the understanding gap as much as possible. I've given up the hard clinge on being understood (or so I think), yet certain traditions, knowledge and exploration helped me feel less alone in my journey. Far more so, living beings, the very PEOPLE that been close to me contributed to my well-being. 

So, what did I explore and what helped me as a teaching, or at least a transitory knowledge? 

### Jung's concepts
Yep. This guy and his team made a serious contribution to knowledge of oneself. It's like the Tao of the West. It's dangerous. And healing. I am thankful about knowledge of cognitive functions through MBTI and similar frameworks. It helps to understand your EGO, to, hopefully, give it up for something better. To know what's going on in the present, accept it... and, again (hopefully!) with the help of God and one's community to go beyong it, to change when needed. 

Here is an article by Kenny Ammann on the Jung's concepts from a Christian standpoint (includes references to Morton Kelsey, an Episcopal priest): [link](http://www.ldolphin.org/individ.html) 

### Yoga 
Jung supposedly told about dangers of doing it too much, or for too long. I was certainly overrelying on some routines, or didn't understand it right, or something... For the reference, I practiced mildly for a long period of time (around 5 years). For me it was healing at first, gaining some self-control. And later, it was isolating and delusional. Note: I practiced without a teacher when I got 'too far'.  

### Buddhists 

Listened to Thich Nhat Hanh teachings. 
A lot of teachings on mindfulness. 

Physically: been to plently of temples while I was in China (Beijing, HangZhou, Shanghai). 

Buddhist temples and monasteries sometime have teachers, masters, lamas: plenty of sources to get more info, advice.

Buddha's teaching on the Path of cessation of suffering has a potential to set free a lot of people, help to give up false ideas, and stand stronger in their beliefs. Including Christian beliefs. 

I am strongly in support of the teachings, and knowledge exchange with Buddha's followers. 

### Taoists
People have developed their deities under the Tao concept. However, Taoist philosophy is no deist per se, neither are Buddhist and Confucian teachings (none of them have Gods from their origin). 
Rituals help to learn, and keep teachings alive through traditions. Tao is, per my understanding, nature of things. It's just is. What do you do with it is up to you. It can be a helpful philosophical framework. Similar to the Buddha's teachings, it helps to unlearn false ideas. Similar to Jung's teachings - it might be dangerous to keep it as a sole ideal - in my opinion. And that can be too loud coming from me. 

The core values that the Tao Te Ching promotes: Humility. Moderation. Compassion. 
The philosophy of Tao - you don't need to understand the Tao, it's the way, not the finite state. 

### Unitarian Universalists
Post-Christian tradition. Liberal religion. Has its roots in Christian Unitarian and Universalist traditions. 
Values of social justice, initiative, democratic process. 
Very accepting to all kinds of people and backgrounds. 

My personal stance: without a strong tradition of Faith already in your region, in your community, a tradition with a structure and solid creed... it's too liberal. 

Example:  mainline protestants, or Theravada tradition in Buddhism - those that have a serious history. Those that keep their scripture and the teachings: there might be some dogma to be questioned, too, if it was based on the original teachings. The tradition with a proof to show for their work: societies that strive to the ideal, while individuals have more Love than Fear in them and in their mutual interactions. 

### Quakers 
Christian Protestant roots. 
Not all Quakers consider themselves Christians. Some do. I do. 

Contemplative yet actionable, with values of peace and integrity. Equility and simplicity. Community. 

### Other groups, or people from Christian traditions that I happened to be around:
Amish, Anabaptists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Lutherans. 
Eastern Orthodox and Catholics. 

They all either keep the search of Truth, or support the Christian tradition as a whole.
