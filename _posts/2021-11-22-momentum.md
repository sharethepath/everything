The Heart Sutra (Tibetan version) reads ("all-caps" are mine):
likewise there is no Suffering, Origin, Cessation or Path, no wisdom-knowledge, NO ATTAINMENT AND NON-ATTAINMENT.
Therefore Sariputra, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ATTAINMENT, Bodhisattvas abide relying on the Perfection of Wisdom, without obscurations of thought, and so are unafraid.

Yet ... being aware of your current momentum, appreciating the thing that is already here and is not so easily attainable by others: 
- access to ... Dharma, Plum Village 
- sustenance 
- 34... soon to be 35... 
- ready for ...co-living, sharing (community, brotherhood, sisterhood) 
- been exposed to different cultures 

chanda? 
- current need, 1: foundation .. society, community, values, direction; proper status, residence 
- current need, 2: community, values joy, non-violence 
- current need, 3: right livelihood 

- current desire, 1: become a monastic; 35 years old... 
- current desire, 2: sustenance - health... congruent to the Noble Eightfold Path; 
- current desire, 3: location - looks about right; China and Belarus were before 
- current desire, 4: life satisfaction, from time to time? If there is Joy, and the way of Enlightment... why crave for it? 

- **current need, 3: ~ proper attachment, secure attachment; Triple gem: Sangha, Dharma, Buddha.**

Who speaks in love and not in hatred... 


rfre... attachment to ...Sangha. Spiritual people, community

And it is said that imperfect confidence (assaddhiyam) in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha is the condition that develops unsystematic reflection; and imperfect confidence is due to non-hearing of the True Law, the dhamma (asaddhamma savanam). **Finally, one does not hear the dhamma through lack of contact with the wise, through not consorting with the good (asappurisa sansevo).**
