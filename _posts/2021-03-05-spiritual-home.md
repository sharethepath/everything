Search for Spiritual home. 

I suppose that there should be feedback, compassionate human interaction there. Someone capable and willing to listen, understand. 

So far explored: 
### Buddhists: listened to Thich Nhat Hanh. 
Physically: been to plently of temples while I was in China (Beijing, HangZhou, Shanghai). 
Buddhist temples and monasteries sometime have teachers, masters, lamas. 

### Taoists
They have developed their deities, too. However, Taoist philosophy is no deist, neither are Buddhist and Confucian teachings (none of them have Gods from their origin). Many of us people, however, have a natural inclination to believe. Furthermore, having faith is important. 

### Quakers, Unitarian Universalists 
Christian, protestant roots of some liberal traditions. 

**Quakers** are more contemplative, peaceful. 
**Unitarian Universalists** responsible search; values of wisdom and courage. 
They can be very welcoming. 

### Other Protestant groups 
Amish, Anabaptists, Baptists, Adventists, Presbyterians, even Mormons - only read a little bit about them.
Some of them tend to be workaholics. Very actionable.
