The graph chart above illustrates non-cash transactions in the United Kingdom between 1991 and 2007. It depicts information on how different payment methods were used during the years. 

First of all, cheques payments were down from 3 billion to less than 1 billion transactions. The fall was consistent throughout the years.  Meanwhile, it was the dominant method in 1991. Unlike cheques, debit cards had been the least popular method in 1991, but then they demonstrated a steep rise up to almost 5 billion transactions by 2007. That, by the way, was more than 5x times higher than the usage of cheques in 2007. They surpassed credit cards and cheques in 1995 and 1999 respectively and became the most popular method in the United Kingdom. 

Furthermore, credit and charge cards usage surged from around 600 million transactions to almost 2 billion by 2004, then leveled out until 2007. 

To conclude, the overall picture changed significantly by 2007, with the debit cards method dominating the non-cash transactions.
