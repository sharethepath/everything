NO clinging to INFJ identity! 
Impermanence and Non-Self from Buddhist concepts could be of help.

# INFJ and finding a way 
on a right track when.. 
  - work towards something you personally believe is important, especially long-term goal
  - when you are able to guide others towards your values? (well, ...) and see that others do understand and appreciate this ~ otherwise - it's forcing. 
  - figuring something out that helps to address old persisting issue ~

Quote `with all these functions and forces pulling them in different directions, it can be difficult for INFJs to know their true path. Personality, environment, society, childhood experiences and genes all work together to affect peopleâ€™s choices and preferences, so there is not one right way for all INFJs. But when it comes to making choices that will make them happy, INFJs are Feeling types who need to connect their ideas with people.`
