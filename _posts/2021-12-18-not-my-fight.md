"Choose your battles"... 

Not my fight: Language (whether it is Belarusian, Russian, English or Chinese). 
Not my fight: RF 

I do like, however: English language. I seem to like values of contemporary (2000s) nations like the US, Canada and France. 

Reverence. 
Buddha, Dharma, Sangha... 
Health and sustenance. 
The Path of cessation of suffering, self and others.
