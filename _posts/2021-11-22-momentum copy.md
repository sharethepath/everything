Self-trust 

Each of the three poisons—attachment, aversion, and ignorance—points to the problem of grasping, of holding on. In the case of attachment, it’s obvious. Whether it’s money or identity or just our own explanation of how things are, there are things we can’t seem to let go of.

Shunryu Suzuki Roshi said: shine one corner of the world.


Generosity, ethical discipline, patience, joyous perseverance, daily meditation can all be worked on every single day. Ethical discipline is completely independent of what is going on around us.

Be the change you wish to see in the world.
