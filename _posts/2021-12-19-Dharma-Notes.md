Notes. Makes sense to share if it has a good chance to bring goodness to myself and others. 


Being Present.

On parents. 
The Buddha said we should not associate with bad people. 

protecting yourself, having boundaries, knowing you donâ€™t deserve unwholesome company

You don't need to be selfish or mean to do that. To think that is the case, is really to take the abusers ideas as your own. That's what they would say to continue abusing you if you tried to set boundaries, leave, etc. Being compassionate also mean being compassionate to yourself. Telling yourself the same things that an abuser would tell you, not exactly very self compassionate.
