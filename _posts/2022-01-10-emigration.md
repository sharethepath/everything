Emigration (from Belarus). 
2022. 

Choosing location (Prague? Buenos Aires? Sao Paulo? Shanghai?)
Thinking of regional culture, language; great chance to be a resident, a citizen; 
Setting time (it was set for ... December-January). 
Overcoming challenges: 
- choice? (CZ, many reasons, possible citizenship, Plum Village proximity, Ma's proximity; EU and perceived security)
- doubt? 
- visa? (waiting. No prompts.)
- interactions? (unclear) 
Tracking the progress (docs done, now is the time). 



What happens with you anywhere atm? For me it's
- ... women; (society/community required, accepted as a Buddhist + feeling secure/safe myself); 
- painful interactions with some of my relatives; 
- sustenance and freedom issues (codependency): financial, accommodation, etc; 
- inconsistent jobs/projects/skills, the most frequent: English, writing/speaking; Ethics. Body and manners.
