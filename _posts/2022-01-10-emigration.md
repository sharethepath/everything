2022. 

Choosing location (Prague? Buenos Aires? Sao Paulo? Shanghai?)
Thinking of regional culture, language; great chance to be a resident, a citizen; 
Setting time (it was set for ... December-January). 
Overcoming challenges: 
- choice? (CZ, many reasons, possible citizenship, Plum Village proximity, Ma's proximity; EU and perceived security). No clear option but refugee, and that's not the greatest intent. 3 months visa is too short. Pl visa is 10 months. Polish language... well... Paid to the agent. 
- doubt? day by day... first going to Pl as a step forward, then we will see... Because of alright chance for work/income. 
Tracking the progress (docs done, now is the time). 



What happens with you anywhere atm? For me it's
- ... women; (society/community required, accepted as a Buddhist + feeling secure/safe myself); 
- painful interactions with some of my relatives; 
- sustenance and freedom issues (codependency): financial, accommodation, etc; 
- inconsistent jobs/projects/skills, the most frequent: English, writing/speaking; Ethics. Body and manners.
