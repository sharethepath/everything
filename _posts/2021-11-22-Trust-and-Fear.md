Self-trust 

Each of the three poisons—attachment, aversion, and ignorance—points to the problem of grasping, of holding on. In the case of attachment, it’s obvious. Whether it’s money or identity or just our own explanation of how things are, there are things we can’t seem to let go of.

Shunryu Suzuki Roshi said: shine one corner of the world.


Generosity, ethical discipline, patience, joyous perseverance, daily meditation can all be worked on every single day. Ethical discipline is completely independent of what is going on around us.

Be the change you wish to see in the world.

When we are trustworthy ourselves and trust others, we make a genuine and important contribution towards a more pleasant and harmonious society.

On innate and transactional trust. 
'''You simply trust that however the relationship unfolds, your vulnerability to the other is a worthy act. The occasional disappointment is the cost of having a healthy sense of trust. When you meet someone who extends innate trust to you, you feel deep unconditional acceptance. You in turn can learn to do this for others. Keep in mind that this does not mean you’re supposed to abandon common sense or in any way become a victim of another’s abuses.

as well as Demand Trust and Trusting the Nature of things 
'''
While it is easy to know the pain of being subjected to demand trust, it is not so easy to recognize when you have unconsciously become the perpetrator and used trust as a weapon because of your own vulnerability. This is something most of us do on occasion. During my conversation with the yogi about her trust issue, she came to see that she was being almost deliberately naive in regard to her lover who had disappointed her in a manner that was totally consistent with his personality.
