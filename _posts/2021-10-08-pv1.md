What comes to mind while thinking of Plum Village tradition? 

- Renewed Buddhism. "Relevant to time". More open and simple for those who come from different cultures. 

- Vegan diet, at least partially for lay people. That's unusual even for Buddhists. Times are different now than it was hundred years ago - everyday species all over the planet are deminishing. Meanwhile, today's vegan choices for many locations are quite decent, and can be done. Plus, it's a healthy choice for many, when done right. Nevertheless, a privilege in many regions (especially where the winters are long). 

- It provides a monastic path for those of us with the main aspiration in peace and compassion. Both, women and men!
