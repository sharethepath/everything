1. Getting more clarity. Mostly by actions, reaching out people. 
2. External help - could be of benefit as a support structure, talking out. 
People with similar values, or a certain tradition. 
Compassionate interactions. 

3. Importance of waiting well - that's it - staying engaged in alright activities. 

How do you fill your days at that moment? 

Here is my example (summer 2021) while searching for  a proper way to make a living (work/business): 
- exploring more on a spiritual path, community (Christian traditions, Quakers and UU in particular, Buddha's teachings); 
- acquaring new skills: signed up for a Project Management course. 
- applied for work by sending my CV, mostly in IT field. 
- thought about helping people that I can relate and hence help better on their issues. 
- reaching out to friends. 

After the decision is made - making it work. 
- Remember why have you started this (like being able to contribute to certain ways for beings, freedom of speech, financial independence, trust issues, etc).
