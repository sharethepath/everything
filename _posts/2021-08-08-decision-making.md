1. Getting more clarity. Mostly by actions, reaching out people. 
2. External help - could be of benefit as a support structure, talking out. 
People with similar values, or a certain tradition. 
Compassionate interactions. 

3. Importance of waiting well - that's it - staying engaged in alright activities. 

How did I fill my days at that moment (Summer 2021): 
- prayers, meditations; nice poems, lyrics, quotes, music pieces. 
- teachings of TNH, Tara Brach, Jack Kornfield, 
- expressing myself and journaling, 
- Reddit 
- Exercising  

After the decision is made - making it work. Remembering why have you started this (being able to contribute to certain ways for beings, freedom and independence, trust issues, etc).
