Besides beings having a way to live a satisfying life (and have a good transition, or finale, as is death), 
there is something that aspires. 

Containing all of the ways that beings around have (beings that include all kinds of species!) - build a coherent society: achieving new grounds of virtues (compare only yourself) - love, power, joy - you name it, and is capable to evolve, as well as (in spite of all!) prioritising ... love, perhaps tough love (that is supportive and preserves the ~ dignity of the being). 

Accepting nature of things in a being, and providing him/her a legit way to live. Approval. 

Different societies accept and approve on different premises. 

Like for monks. Some societies have ways for it. Otherwise, beings break: drinking problems, health issues, suicides. 

### What wakes up your instincts (ego?), fascinates, and that is also healing? wholesome desires ~ 
For me it's 
- Exercising, if not alone - under supervision in a group setting. 
- Podcasts in the form of interview: Tim Ferris and the guests of his show; Jason Gaddis on Relationships. Before (until 2019) it was Personality Hacker podcast; video casts by Quakers. 
- Guided Audio: including those by Thay and Tara Brach.
